Django Authentication
It authenticates user with email and password rather than username and password. <br>
It handles errors. <br>
This includes a register page, a login page and a home page <br>
User cannot navigate directly to home page without logging in and this was made possible with the help of decorators <br>
This also uses csrf tokens for preventing attacks from unauthorised users/sources.
